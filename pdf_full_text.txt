preparation procedures on Xα, Liu and Williams also used
EELS to measure the Li concentration in the matrix of a
specimen containing 12.7% Li aged for 4 h at 563 K. The
result was 8.8% Li. Perhaps 4 h of aging at 563 K is not
quite long enough to attain thermodynamic equilibrium,
but Xα should be close enough to Xαe to add this value to
the δ′ solvus. Therefore, the datum Xαe =0.088 at 563 K is
